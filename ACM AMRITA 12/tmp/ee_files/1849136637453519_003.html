<h2>Problem E: Sequence<br>
</h2>
Given a sequence S of '0' and '1' of length N,  a subsequence of S is 
obtained by omitting some elements of S without changing the order of 
the remaining elements of S.<br>
<br>
Given a subarray of a sequence S starting from some position 'a' and 
ending at some position 'b' (1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= N), both inclusive,
 denoted by S(a,b), you have report the length of longest non-decreasing
 subsequence of S(a,b). By non-decreasing, we mean that a '0' never 
appears after a '1' in the subsequence.<br>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Then T test case follow, each test case being in the following format.<br>
The first line contains N, the length of sequence S. The next line 
contains a string of 0's and 1's of length exactly N. The next line 
contains Q, which means that you have to answer Q queries. The next Q 
lines contain a pair of integers a,b (1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= N), 
meaning that you have to report the length of longest non decreasing 
subsequence of S(a,b).<br>
There is no blank line between test cases.<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
Output Q lines per test case, which is the answer for each query. Do not print a blank line between test cases.<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10<br>
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000<br>
1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 100,000<br>
<h3>Sample Input:</h3>

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>

9<br>
6<br>

4<br>
</span><br>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
In the first query, the longest subsequence is formed by picking 1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th,7th,10th,11th,12th digits of the sequence.<br>
In the second query, you can pick the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th digits.<br>
