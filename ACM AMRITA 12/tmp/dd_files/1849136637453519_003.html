<h2>Problem D: Team Decision<br>
</h2>
It is the ICPC season again, and one of the crucial things your team has
 to decide is which regional (Amrita or Kanpur) to go to.  In order to 
maximize your team's chances of success, your team should go to the 
regional that none of your rivals are going to. In fact, every team has 
this same objective.  
<br><br>
Now, assuming that each team goes to exactly one regional and knowing 
the set of rivals for each team, how many ways are there of assigning 
teams to regionals such that the above objective is satisfied?    
<br><br>
The rivalry relation is not symmetric. That is, team A may think of team
 B as its rival, but not vice versa.
Also, two assignments of teams (to Amrita and Kanpur) are considered 
different if the set of teams assigned to either regional differs 
(between the assignments).
Since the number of ways can go too large, your answer should be output 
modulo 10^9 + 7.
<br>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line gives the number of test-cases, T.<br>
Each test case begins with N, the number of teams registered.  Teams are numbered 0 to N-1.<br>
The next N lines describe the rivalry relation:  the i'th of these lines
 begins with an integer K (between 0 and N-1), denoting the number of 
rivals of the i'th team. This is followed by K integers, denoting the 
rivals of the i'th team.<br>
There is a blank line after each test case.<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
For each test case, output the possible number of assignments to the two
 regionals such that no team goes to the same regional as any of its 
rivals. Don't forget to output your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
T &lt;= 10<br>
N &lt;= 20,000<br>
Total number of rivalries among all teams &lt;= 100,000<br>
<h3>Sample Input:</h3>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2<br>
4<br>
2 1 3<br>
2 0 2<br>
2 1 3<br>
2 0 2<br>
<br>
2<br>
1 1<br>
0</span><br>
<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2<br>
2</span><br>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
In the first test case, teams 0 &amp; 2 think that 1 &amp; 3 are their 
rivals, and vice versa. So, the 2 possibilities are {0, 2} going to 
Amrita and {1, 3} going to Kanpur, or {0, 2} going to Kanpur and {1, 3} 
going to Amrita.<br>
