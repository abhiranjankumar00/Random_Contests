If chef has three types for sweets S_1, S_2, S_3 and three boxes (B1, B2, B3). He has to pack 6 sweets in each boxes. If he pack sweets in a way that box has configuration B1{S_1 = 1, S_2 = 0, S_3 = 5}, B2(S_1 = 1, S_2 = 3, S_3 = 2) and B3(S_1 = 1, S_2 = 0, S_3 = 5), then Box B1 and B2 are said to have different configuration, while Box B1 and B3 are same.

But wait, there are some sweets of which customers are very fond of. So they gave you a list of such sweets and the minimum number for each sweet they want in their box.
