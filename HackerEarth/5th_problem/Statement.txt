Title: Paper Planes, Difficulty: Medium (Ternary Search)

Its spring :) Time for paper plane. Kasukabe Defense Group have decided to have a paper plane competetion. Masao and Bo, both Shinchan friends, are good at Origami, a japanese art of designing using papers. They have designed very good paper planes which can fly for t seconds and at a constant speed and direction.

They, both, throw their plane in air simultanously. Bingo!!! Kazama gets another chance to show his superior mathematical skill. Now he calculated the minimum distance between them during their flight of t seconds. He knows the initial coordiante of Bo's plane and Masao's plane and along with their speed and direction.

Input:
First line of input contains an integer, t, time duration of flight. Then in next line initial coordinate of Bo's plane (b_x, b_y, b_z) is given. Next line contains another three space separated integers, bv_x, bv_y, bv_z, the speed of Bo's plane in x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectevely. In next line, initial coordinate of Masao' Plane (m_x, m_y, m_z) is provided followed by its speed (mv_x, mv_y, mv_z) in x-axis, y-axis and z-axis, respectively in next line.

Output:
Print the minimum distance which Bo's and Masao's plane can get during the flight. You answer mush have absolute error equal to or less than 10^-6.


Constraints:
0 <= t <= 10000
-10000 <= b_x, b_y, b_z <= 10000
-10000 <= bv_x, bv_y, bv_z <= 10000
-10000 <= m_x, m_y, m_z <= 10000
-10000 <= mv_x, mv_y, mv_z <= 10000
