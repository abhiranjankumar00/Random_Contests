Masao and Naini, both Shinchan friends, are playing Home-Home. During the game, they become short of tiffin box. Naini has N food items to be packed in the tiffins and maximum weight each tiffin box can hold is W units. Let the wieght of N items be w_0, w_1, ..., w_(N-1) units and each item's weight lies between 1 and W (inclusive). Find the arrangement so that the number of tiffin box required to pack all food items is minimised.

Let's say Naini used K tiffins (t_0, t_1,..., t_(K-1)) for packing N items. For each i'th tiffin {i <- [0, K-1]}, print the indexes of food items, j {j <- [0, N-1]}, which is placed in it. Each food item must be placed in only one tiffin.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= W <= 10^5
1 <= w_i <= W

Input
First line of input contains two space separated intergers, N W, numbers of food items to be packed and maximum wieght each tiffin can hold.
Next line contans N space separted integers, w_0, w_1...w_(N-1), weights of 0'th item, 1'st item, ..., (N-1)'th item.

Output
In first line print an integer, K, numbers of tiffins required for packing all the food items. Then print K lines. Each of these line represents the content of a box. Each of these lines contains a number M (1 <= M), number of food items to be placed in current box followed by M space separated indexes of food items. 

Scoring:
Maximum number of tiffins required is N.
The score will be equal to (N - K) / N * [Score of problem]

Explanation for Case #1:
We used 4 box. 1st box contains 3 items, w_0 = 1, w_1 = 2, w_5 = 3. 2nd box contains 1 item, w_3 = 3. Similarly 3rd and 4th box contains 1 item each, w_2 = 4 and w_4 = 5, respectvely.

Expalanation for Case #2:
We used 3 box. 1st box contains 2 items, w_0 = 1, w_4 = 5. 2nd box contains 2 items, w_1 = 2, w_2 = 4. 3rd box also contains 2 items, w_5 = 3, w_3 = 3.
