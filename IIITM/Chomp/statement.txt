Mr. Kala and Mr. UD are both fond of chocolate (and ofcourse Nusrat). A chocolate bar can be represented as a 3xN block of bars. On a particular day the leftmost-lowest block has been mixed with a very bitter ingredient by a mischievous friend Mr. AnimeKING. He then gave that single chocolate to them and told about his mischeif. 

Mr. AnimeKING asked them to play a game with the given chocolate. A move of game consists of eating a block of bar along with all the blocks of bar which lies on the right and above it. Player alternate moves, and the person who eats the leftmost-lowest (bitter) block of bar is declared loser.

Example:
	For a chocolate of size 3x8. Block (1, 1) had been bittered.
	
Player 1:	Choses a block at (2, 6) to eat.

Player 1:	Doesn't have any option. So had to eat the bitter part of chocolate and be the loser.

Of course this is not an optimal game.

As player 1 realised that he is noob after playing some steps, he ask you to help him to find whether now there exists any chance for him to win. Player 2 is expert at this game.

Given number of bar' blocks in row1, row2 and row3 (row1 >= row2 >= row3) and *its player 1 turn*, find that if from now he play optimally whether he can win the game or not.


Input
First line of input containts number of test cases T. Then follows T lines, each line containing three positive integers row1, row2, row3, number of blocks of bar in row 1, row 2 and row 3 respectively.

Output:
For each input, tell whether player 1 can win if he play optimally or not. Print "WIN" if player 1 can win, otherwise print "LOSE" (quotes for clarity).

Constraint: 
	a)  1 <= row1 <= 100
	b)  0 <= row3 <= row2 <= row1
	b)	Now it's player 1' turn.
	d) 	0 < T <= 10^4
	e)  Both players play optimally.

Sample Input:
2
1 1 1
2 2 1

Sample Output:
WIN
LOSE


Explanation for first test case:

	Player 1: Eats block (2, 1).
