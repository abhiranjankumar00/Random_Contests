Mr. 10-pointer and Mr. Gyani had been trying to count the number of ways to perfectly cover a 1-by-n board with monominoes and dominoes.

With pen-and-pencil they are only able calculate the count for small n. 
Such as:
1-by-1 = 1 (only one monomino)
1-by-2 = 2(either use two monomino or one domino)
1-by-3 = 3 (either all monomino, or 1 monomino followed by a domino, or 1 domino followed by a monomino).

So they approached Ms. Pavani to help them calculate the same for large n. Help her to code the solution which print the total number of ways mod (10^8 + 7).

Input:
The first line of the input contains number of test cases, T. Then follows T lines containing a number n, size of baord.

Output:
For each test case print the number of ways to cover a 1-by-n board mod (10^8 + 7).

Constraints: 
a) 0 < n <= 10^6
b) 0 < T <= 10^5

Sample Input:
4
1
2
3
500

Sample Output:
1
2
3
12577845

Note: 
a) Perfect cover means the whole board should be completely covered, no two monomino/domino overlap each other, neither any of them lie outside of the boundary of baord.

b) Monomino is of block size 1-by-1, and orintation of the monomino is not to be considered.

c) Size of a domino is 1-by-2.
