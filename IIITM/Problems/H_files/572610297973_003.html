The wizards and witches of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft found Prof. 
Binn's History of Magic lesson to be no less boring than you found your 
own history classes.  Recently Binns has been droning on about Goblin 
wars, and which goblin civilization fought which group of centaurs where
 etc etc.  The students of Hogwarts decided to use the new-fangled 
computer to figure out the outcome of all these wars instead of 
memorizing the results for their upcoming exams.  Can you help them?
<br>
The magical world looks like a 2-D R*C grid. Initially there are many 
civilizations, each civilization occupying exactly one cell. A 
civilization is denoted by a lowercase letter in the grid. There are 
also certain cells that are uninhabitable (swamps, mountains, sinkholes 
etc.) - these cells are denoted by a '#' in the grid. All the other 
cells - to which the civilizations can move  - are represented by a '.' 
in the grid.
<br>
A cell is said to be adjacent to another cell if they share the same 
edge - in other words, for a cell (x,y), cells (x-1, y), (x, y-1), (x+1,
 y), (x, y+1) are adjacent, provided they are within the boundaries of 
the grid.   Every year each civilization will expand to all unoccupied 
adjacent cells. If it is already inhabited by some other civilization, 
it just leaves the cell alone. It is possible that two or more 
civilizations may move into an unoccupied cell at the same time - this 
will lead to a battle between the civilizations and the cell will be 
marked with a '*'. Note that the civilizations fighting in a particular 
cell do not try to expand from that cell, but will continue to expand 
from other cells, if possible.
<br>
Given the initial grid, output the final state of the grid after no 
further expansion by any civilization is possible.
<br><br>
 

Input :
<br>
The first line contains T, the number of cases. This is followed by T 
test case blocks.
<br>
Each test case contains two integers, R, C.
<br>
This is followed by R lines containing a string of length C. The j-th 
letter in the i-th row describes the state of the cell in year 0.
<br>
Each cell is either a
<br>
1. '.' which represents an unoccupied cell
<br>
2. '#' which represents a cell that cannot be occupied
<br>
3. A civilization represented by a lowercase letter ('a' - 'z')<br><br>
Output :<br><br>

For each test case, print the final grid after no expansion is possible.
 Apart from the notations used in the input, use '*' to denote that a 
battle is being waged in that particular cell. <br><br>

Print a blank line at the end of each case.<br>
