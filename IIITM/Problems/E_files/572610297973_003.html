<b>Problem</b><br>
Rohit and Shreya love playing tic-tac-toe but they have no idea how to 
find who is the winning the game. Given a valid/invalid game position 
you have to find who wins the game.Rohit always plays with 'X' and 
Shreya always plays with 'O'. If both are winning the game then print 
"ambiguous". If no one is winning the game then print "Game is on!".
<br>
First line of input is number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=100). Each 
test case will consist of 3 lines describing the game. Each line will 
have either X or O or 
_ (blank). Output T lines with  result.
