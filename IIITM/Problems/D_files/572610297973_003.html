<b>Problem</b><br>
You are given a set of cities(named 0 to N-1) and set of roads 
connecting them. Cities are connected with bidrectional roads. Due to 
rain all the roads are broken. The cost of fixing each road depends on 
its length ( 1 cost unit per km ). You want to minimize the cost of 
fixing roads. For that you fix only few roads, such that all cities are 
still conneted and total cost of fixing roads is minimum. 
<br>
First line of input is number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=100). First 
line of each test case consist of 2 integers N(number of cities) and 
M(number of roads). Next M lines has 3 integers U V D,city U and V are 
connected with a road of distance D. Output T lines with minimum cost of
 fixing roads.
