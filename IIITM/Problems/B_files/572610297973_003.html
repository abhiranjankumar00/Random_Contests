For fun you count the number of students in front of you who are taller 
than you. Then you started asking same question to all the students 
standing in queue and add the count for each student. Given the height 
of of each student in the queue, what is the final result?
<br>
First line of input is number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=100). Each 
test case will consist of 2 lines. First line will consist of N number 
of students in queue. Next line will have N integers defining the height
 of each student. Front of queue is leftmost point in queue.  Output T 
lines with final count.
